# HB63C09

This is the repository of the HB63C09 Home brew computer. 

This is a HD63C09 based system built on the ITX form factor.

Not much is here right now, but currently working on updating the firmware to get support for SD cards as well as I2C.
once the firmware is in a stable state I will release the project construction files so anybody can try out the design

The Sketch in the Arduino directory is often in a unworking state.
when I get to where its more complete I will release a stable branch, for now think of this as the DEVEL branch all the time.
